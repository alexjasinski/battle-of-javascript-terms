## Beginners Guide

If you are a total beginner to the BATTLE-OF-JS-TERMS game, I would suggest to get familiar first with the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe game, a.k.a. Paper, Scissors & Rock.
The logic behind the game is quite similar. After clickling on start, you will have the option to choose from five different JavaScript terms.
The bot will choose randomly an opposite term, which will win or loose against the user's term or it might be a tie if it is the same term. The bot's choice is displayed on the top of the main game screen. The result of the battle is displayed in the middle of the main game screen.
You can win the game if you manage to reach 10 points displayed in the scoreboard below the main game screen.


User story
---

The user is supposed to click on one of the five terms related to JavaScript.
The computer will generate another opposing random term based on a formula.


! CAUTION: IN THIS VERSION, THE USED ARGUMENTS FOR WINNING OR LOOSING AGAINST THE BOT HAVE BEEN ALSO GENERATED BY A BOT AND MIGHT THEREFORE MAKE NO SENSE WHATSOEVER !

The outputs can be one of the following:

Function executes code and defeats Variable: Functions win against Variables because they can execute code and operate on Variables.

Method manipulates Objects and defeats Function: Methods win against Functions because they can manipulate Objects and invoke Functions.

Object contains Variables and defeats Method: Objects win against Methods because they can contain Variables and manipulate their values.

Variable stores data and defeats Object: Variables win against Objects because they can store different types of data and represent various entities.

String represents textual data and defeats Function: Strings win against Functions because they can store and manipulate textual data.

Method manipulates Objects and defeats Function: Methods win against Functions because they can manipulate Objects and invoke Functions.

Variable stores data and defeats Object: Variables win against Objects because they can store different types of data and represent various entities.

Function represents executable code and defeats String: Functions win against Strings because they can execute code and perform operations beyond textual data manipulation.

User flows
---
```sequence
Game start --> user chooses term "function" --> bot generates randomly "variable" and his choice is being displayed on the to of the main game screen -->  user's term wins against bot's term --> the outcome of the comparison is displayed in the middle of the main game screen --> one point is added to the scoreboard under "You" --> when score reaches 10, the game is over --> user can click on "Restart Game"
