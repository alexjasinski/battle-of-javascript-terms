USAGE

The user is supposed to click on one of the five terms related to JavaScript.
The computer will generate another opposing random term based on a formula.
The outputs can be one of the following:

Function executes code and defeats Variable: Functions win against Variables because they can execute code and operate on Variables.

Method manipulates Objects and defeats Function: Methods win against Functions because they can manipulate Objects and invoke Functions.

Object contains Variables and defeats Method: Objects win against Methods because they can contain Variables and manipulate their values.

Variable stores data and defeats Object: Variables win against Objects because they can store different types of data and represent various entities.

String represents textual data and defeats Function: Strings win against Functions because they can store and manipulate textual data.
